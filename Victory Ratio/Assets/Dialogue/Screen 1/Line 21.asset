  textLine: "Mentor: It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that each soldier only
    has a 50% chance of killing an enemy soldier when they attack, so it\u2019s like
    you flip a coin for each soldier attacking. This also means that a group of soldiers
    cannot wipeout a larger group with a single attack. "
